# Business Problem

Imagine you are an HR analyst at a mid-sized fashion product producer. 

"The company is very much focused on promoting diversity as part of its brand. The CEO, Janet King, has also made it clear that she wants to ensure a diverse workforce. However, she also believes that the company already has a very diverse workforce. 

You, on the other hand, are not so sure. And you want to utilize data to help you answer this question."
